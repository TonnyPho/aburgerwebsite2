<h1 style="color:white;">Burgers</h1>

<h2 style="text-align: center; color:white; font-size: 20px; font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Welcome to the page that contains information about burgers, the origin, and a list of burgers<h2>
<h2 style="color:white;">Origin:<h2>
<h3 style="color:red; text-decoration: underline;"> there are many people who have claimed to invent/first create a burger or the sandwich.
<h4 style="color:white; font-size: 30px; font-family: Arial;"> There are rumors that the first burger originated from Hamburg, Germany. In the 19th century, beef from German Hamburg cows was minced and combined with garlic, onions, salt and pepper which formed into patties to make Hamburg steaks. They were considered as gourmet and were pretty pricey due to the quality.<br>

<h5 style="color:white; font-size: 30px; font-family: Arial;"> German immigrants began arriving in New York and Chicago, and many opened restaurants. The menus often featured Hamburg steak (Americanized version of the german offering)

<h6 style="color:white; font-size: 30px; font-family: Arial;"> During the Industrial Revolution, most workers were served Hamburg Steak. They were difficult to eat while standing so one cook sandwiched the meat between two slices of bread and one of the first sandwiches were born. (Sadly the cook that came up with the idea is forgotten since nobody has remembered his name)
